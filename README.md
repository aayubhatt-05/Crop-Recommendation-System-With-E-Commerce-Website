# Crop-Recommendation-System-With-E-Commerce-Website

Crop Recommendation System with E-Commerce Website is a smart web-based tool designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crop based on real-time soil and climate parameters like N, P, K values, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall using a Machine Learning model.

Alongside crop recommendations, the integrated E-Commerce platform allows farmers to browse, add to cart, and manage agricultural products such as seeds, fertilizers, and tools.

This system does not include a payment gateway. The “Buy Now” or “Checkout” features are simulated for demonstration purposes only.

This project promotes data-driven agriculture and simplifies access to farming resources — all without online transactions.
